# Handwritten Text Recognition using Pseudo Segmentation and Seq2Seq model

Software requirements:

- Tensorflow 1.4
- OpenCV 3

The experiments folder includes all associated code for the method. For the data, the IAM and RIMES dataset can be downloaded and 
preprocessed using read_IAM_database.ipynb and read_RIMES_database.ipynb.

Then, the model can be trained and tested using the file seq2seq_train.py.
